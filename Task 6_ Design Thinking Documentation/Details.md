## Task 6: Design Thinking Documentation
OPEN TO ALL
No submission will be accepted after 3rd November 11:59 pm.

So you made MULTIPLE changes in the Hero Section for the previous task, right?. What were you even thinking about? We need to know what crossed your mind at that moment when you decided to completely change the look of such a well designed section XD. What was your thought process that made you commit such random changes for the Hero Section.

Pen down your thoughts, your design thinking and your knowledge and implementation about hero sections that went into your design. All the reasons must be based on the principles of the designs like contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity, etc. If you don't know about these, then ...umm... just explain why you thought what you did will look good.

  

## Submission Guideline

- Explain your design thinking, what you thought (and did) while redesigning the hero section of the website
- It would be better if the reasons are based on principles of design. In case you feel like you have used them but don't know their names, just try to properly explain why you thought these changes would look good
- Try to include explanation about each and every element of the section like the hero image, the Call-to-Action (buttons), The navigation bar, logo, heading, body paragraph, etc.
- Submit your thoughts in a .txt file and place the file in Task 6: Design Thinking Documentation Folder Only
- NOTE : Also provide the figma link of the Hero Section redesign so that your design thinking can be verified with the changes made.

 

## Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)

Since it is a 30 point task and you don't even need to design anything, just explain your thoughts. Hence the explanation must be detailed and should be based on design principles even if you can't name them. The thinking behind aach and every change that you made in the Hero section should be properly documented.
