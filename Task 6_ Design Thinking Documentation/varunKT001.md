1.  The Navbar (Logo) : 
Starting off with the logo of opencode, Since I first designed the other sections, I already had a color scheme ready, so I thought of changing the logo as well, so it can blend well with rest of the content. It would have been a too simple logo if I had only written text with different color, so I tried to incorporate some shapes like a circle for the 'O' and another
pac-man like shape for the 'C' of OpenCode. 

2. The Navbar (Links) : 
For the links I used to the primary-blue color to show the highlighted link, to tell user that which section they are on. Even if the 
the user finds it difficult to differentiate the active tab just by the color, there is also an underline below the active tab. I also muted the other text using some grey color to give the active link a little more contrast. I tried to keep the color such that
the user can easily see the active tab while not loosing any visibility on the other un-active tabs. 

3. Main Hero (left) : 
The left side contains a heading, some content, and finally the buttons. 
    3.1 Heading : 
    I kept the heading's font size quiet large, because this is only the first thing that will gather the users attention. Also the text inside the heading is kept such that it can give a summary of rest of the content of the website. The color of the heading is the same primary-blue color used in the active links to maintain a consitent color scheme and also avoid too much colors. The text "OpenSource" is made of dual colors (the same used in the Logo in the navbar), this is done to reference github, as opencode's repositories will be hosted on github for contributors to contribute to.

    3.2 Text content : 
    The content gives a brief overview about opencode and also encourages users to give it a try. 

    3.3 Buttons : 
    The buttons section contains two buttons, one primary and one secondry. The primary button is the Devfolio button and the secondry button is the 'join discord' button. The reason behind keeping the devfolio button primary is because using devfolio only, user can participate in opencode. So the main goal for devfolio to be primary is to convince user to participate in opencode. Join discord is secondry because we first need the user to register her/him self to opencode and then join discord to utilize it fully. Also the colors used in the buttons is the same primary-blue color, just to keep it consistent with reset of the section.  

4. Main Hero (right) : 
The right side of the section consists of a illustration of a kid sitting in front of his PC with his hands up and is making the V (victory) sign with his fingers. The kid looking at his PC (also in top of pc there are three lines dipicting some sort of notification, for example : your pr is merged) with joy and making the victory sign dipicts the joyfull side of opensource (and opencode). Also the presence of a kid shows the beginner friendly approach of opencode. It shows that opensource is no rocket science, if you have all the basic knowlege of any tech stack, opensource is a childs play. 

5. Dividing curve : 
There is also a dividing curve present between the left and right sides of the hero sections. It basically used to just seperate the content of the two sides. It also provides a good background for the illustration.
